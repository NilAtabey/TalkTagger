[2.05.2024 22:47] niltheoverkill
OK, first of all, I just wanna say


[2.05.2024 22:47] niltheoverkill
Do not send your pictures to strange men on the Internet


[2.05.2024 22:47] niltheoverkill
Do not even text them


[2.05.2024 22:48] niltheoverkill
Do not even breathe the same air as them


[2.05.2024 22:48] niltheoverkill
But as the adult in the room, it is more his fault than yours


[2.05.2024 22:48] niltheoverkill
Please be more cautious next time


[3.05.2024 01:37] peachyqiss
yeah :( i figured that since we already had a cam-on study session it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad bc he already saw who i was. it was after that that i realized ‚Äúdamn, he‚Äôs a creep‚Äù and wanted to take it all back


[3.05.2024 01:37] peachyqiss
defo won‚Äôt happen again.

[29.08.2024 04:36] peachyqiss
hey nil, reyna passed over ownership to me and i was just wondering if you could gauge how active you'll be on the server. if you can't mod that's fine, but i would love if you could be more active in case we need to update SERENA. i'm intermediate with python but i've never taken on a project like this, so having you around would be really really helpful!


[2.09.2024 08:25] peachyqiss
not trying to rush of pressure you or anything, but if you don't get back to me soon, i'm going to have to start looking for other programmers to help with development if you can't


[2.09.2024 19:44] niltheoverkill
hey, i just saw everything today
firstly - CONGRATS üéä 

uni for me starts in a couple days (unfortunately) so i most certainly will be 10x more active than i am right now, i know almost everything regarding the bot so ofc i'll help to the best of my abilities


[2.09.2024 19:45] niltheoverkill
i think most of the development part has been completed so from now on it will be minor fixes


[2.09.2024 19:46] peachyqiss
THANK YOU! yeah, we just need to have a few fixes and the ability to add things when needed. i know python to an extent but it‚Äôs nice to have someone who‚Äôs well versed with the bot and more fluent/can get projects done more efficiently than me

i‚Äôm glad you‚Äôll be more active!! hopefully we can start up another back to school event or a movie night soon!


[2.09.2024 19:47] niltheoverkill
oh i'd love to get back into hosting events for the server i kinda miss it too


[2.09.2024 19:47] niltheoverkill

[2.09.2024 19:47] peachyqiss

[2.09.2024 19:48] niltheoverkill

[2.09.2024 19:49] peachyqiss
it‚Äôs okay! we all have our struggles and i totally get that! just let me know when something is going on so i can plan ahead okay? no details or anything, a simple ‚Äúhey ruthie something came up and im not going to be online for x amount of time‚Äù works!


[2.09.2024 19:50] peachyqiss
the server isn‚Äôt the only thing in our lives and i totally get that, i just want to stay in the loop so everything is accounted for :)

How are you doing


[17.09.2024 15:26] peachyqiss
hey, i‚Äôm okay


[17.09.2024 15:26] peachyqiss
a little stressed


[17.09.2024 15:27] niltheoverkill
What‚Äôs wrong?


[17.09.2024 15:27] peachyqiss
reyna is asking for owner back and it‚Äôs really out of left field


[17.09.2024 15:27] niltheoverkill
Yeah, actually I came here to talk to you about that


[17.09.2024 15:27] peachyqiss
oh man


[17.09.2024 15:27] peachyqiss

[17.09.2024 15:27] niltheoverkill
I think it‚Äôs very disrespectful that she did that


[17.09.2024 15:27] niltheoverkill
I am aware that she‚Äôs confused and a bit lost so she doesn‚Äôt know what to do


[17.09.2024 15:28] niltheoverkill
But you have every right to say no


[17.09.2024 15:28] niltheoverkill
In fact, I think I would‚Äôve said no myself


[17.09.2024 15:28] niltheoverkill
Whatever you say, I‚Äôm with you on this one


[17.09.2024 15:29] niltheoverkill
You want me to say something to her i will


[17.09.2024 15:29] peachyqiss
nono it‚Äôs okay


[17.09.2024 15:29] peachyqiss

She‚Äôs been thinking of texting you for a long time and she has brought up the idea of asking the ownership back to me in dms like 1-2 weeks ago - I told her that it was a bad idea, but if she really really wanted to, she should just talk to you (i said ‚Äúwhats the harm, just ask‚Äù)


[17.09.2024 15:31] niltheoverkill
And I told her ‚ÄúRuthie has every right to say no, you know that right?‚Äù


[17.09.2024 15:31] niltheoverkill
I‚Äôm translating because the conversation is in Turkish obviously

[17.09.2024 15:34] peachyqiss
this is all that i said after, but yeah


[17.09.2024 15:35] niltheoverkill
Sorry to break it to you but some things she said here seem like lies to me - they‚Äôre small lies, but still lies


[17.09.2024 15:35] niltheoverkill
Yeah no

[17.09.2024 15:36] niltheoverkill
That‚Äôs not the part I should be focused on though, her personal life as long as it doesn‚Äôt affect the server shouldn‚Äôt bother me


[17.09.2024 15:36] niltheoverkill
I think you put it in quite a delicate way


[17.09.2024 15:37] peachyqiss
i just feel bad because I want her to have the opportunity to adjust to her new life without having to worry. she‚Äôs literally moving to a new country and i don‚Äôt want the server to be affected again


[17.09.2024 15:37] niltheoverkill
No takebacksies :fingerWave:


[17.09.2024 15:37] peachyqiss
but she said i was back stabbing her


[17.09.2024 15:37] peachyqiss
and like that really hurts because she knows how loyal i am to her and her ideas?


[17.09.2024 15:38] niltheoverkill
Yeah, I think she knows and she‚Äôs just a bit angry right now


[17.09.2024 15:38] peachyqiss
if i backstabbed her she wouldn‚Äôt be in the staff server, she wouldn‚Äôt have the founder role, etc etc


[17.09.2024 15:38] niltheoverkill
You still gave her the courtesy of staying in the inner circle


[17.09.2024 15:38] niltheoverkill
I think that in itself is really big


[17.09.2024 15:39] peachyqiss
but i did all of that because i do care about her and i want her to see what we‚Äôre doing


[17.09.2024 15:39] peachyqiss
yeah


[17.09.2024 15:39] peachyqiss
i don‚Äôt know


[17.09.2024 15:39] peachyqiss
i feel like she‚Äôs making it really personal


[17.09.2024 15:39] niltheoverkill
She also texted me rn saying Ruthie didn‚Äôt give it back and I said why should she?


[17.09.2024 15:39] niltheoverkill
Yes


[17.09.2024 15:39] peachyqiss

[17.09.2024 15:39] peachyqiss
i think she forgot i was a day 1 too. sure not mod but i saw everything since before it was girls only


[17.09.2024 15:40] peachyqiss
and i was made a mod on like


[17.09.2024 15:40] peachyqiss
day 3


[17.09.2024 15:40] peachyqiss
üò≠


[17.09.2024 15:40] peachyqiss
but you were also day 1, and nisan and jazzi


[17.09.2024 15:40] peachyqiss
i know it‚Äôs a big thing for her and i did say i would give it back, i just want her to be sure


[17.09.2024 15:41] peachyqiss
because she can say she‚Äôs ready, then she‚Äôll actually get to italy and get super stressed again


[17.09.2024 15:41] niltheoverkill
That‚Äôs right and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking is going to happen as well


[17.09.2024 15:41] peachyqiss
same


[17.09.2024 15:41] niltheoverkill
She thinks she‚Äôs ready she is NOT i can tell you that


[17.09.2024 15:41] niltheoverkill
Even if she is - it‚Äôs going to take a lot of mental effort to adjust and also the time


[17.09.2024 15:41] peachyqiss
i can literally pull up the messages where she agreed to the co thing though. it‚Äôs kind of frustrating she‚Äôs going back on that


[17.09.2024 15:43] peachyqiss
like

[17.09.2024 15:44] niltheoverkill
I think you should just hit her with a hard no right now


[17.09.2024 15:44] niltheoverkill
That‚Äôs probably the only thing that‚Äôs going to stop this conversation on and on


[17.09.2024 15:44] peachyqiss
yeah


[17.09.2024 15:45] niltheoverkill
Full 180


[17.09.2024 15:45] peachyqiss
i might just say ‚Äúi can give you co. you can tell me about your ideas for the server and i would love to implement them with you. you will still take responsibility for every facet you develop, like before. but i am not comfortable giving up everything before you adjust to uni in italy for at least a month‚Äù


[17.09.2024 15:46] peachyqiss
actually i might omit the last part


[17.09.2024 15:46] peachyqiss
idk


[17.09.2024 15:46] peachyqiss
she was a good owner but i‚Äôm so nervous


[17.09.2024 15:46] niltheoverkill
Don‚Äôt be


[17.09.2024 15:46] niltheoverkill
You call the shots now


[17.09.2024 15:46] peachyqiss
i know but this was all hers


[17.09.2024 15:47] niltheoverkill
And she made the executive decision to gift it all to you


[17.09.2024 15:47] niltheoverkill
This sounds good, I would keep the last* part, but I don‚Äôt know what your personal relationship with her is


[17.09.2024 15:48] peachyqiss
we‚Äôre close i think


[17.09.2024 15:48] niltheoverkill
If you feel comfortable enough to keep it in, I would say keep it in


[17.09.2024 15:49] peachyqiss
okay, i just don‚Äôt want to go back on it if the month goes by and she‚Äôs still not ready


[17.09.2024 15:49] peachyqiss
i hate going back on my word like that idk


[17.09.2024 15:49] niltheoverkill
I think you should just say we‚Äôll see what happens in a month

{Reactions}
this

[17.09.2024 15:49] niltheoverkill
And I‚Äôll bet you that she‚Äôll be glad she didn‚Äôt take the ownership back in a month


[17.09.2024 15:50] peachyqiss
thank you bio


[17.09.2024 15:50] peachyqiss
nil*


[17.09.2024 15:50] niltheoverkill

[17.09.2024 15:50] peachyqiss
i was really stressing about this but you made it so much better


[17.09.2024 15:50] peachyqiss
seriously thank you so much


[17.09.2024 15:50] niltheoverkill
Don‚Äôt worry, I got your back


[17.09.2024 15:51] peachyqiss
if you need anything let me know


[17.09.2024 15:51] niltheoverkill
Likewise


[17.09.2024 15:51] niltheoverkill
Let me know how it goes, but I assume I‚Äôll be getting information from both sides ü§≠


[17.09.2024 15:51] peachyqiss
i‚Äôll let you know how the thing with reyna goes, i‚Äôll probably text her in like 3/4 hours because that‚Äôs when i get out of class


[17.09.2024 15:51] peachyqiss
yeah ofc ofc


[17.09.2024 15:52] niltheoverkill
yeaah ofc fcus on your class right now this is secondary


[17.09.2024 15:52] niltheoverkill
I texted her no takebacksies :fingerWave: 15 mins ago and she hasnt responded HAHAHAHAZHHS


[17.09.2024 17:35] peachyqiss
NO WAY


[17.09.2024 17:35] niltheoverkill
make that 1.5 hrs rn


[17.09.2024 17:35] peachyqiss
i‚Äôm in between classes right now but i think i‚Äôll just text her the main thing and stop responding when i go to class bc i don‚Äôt want her to think im avoiding her bc im texting in the servers


[17.09.2024 17:36] niltheoverkill
good call


[17.09.2024 17:41] peachyqiss
Hey, I‚Äôm in between classes right now but I have been thinking and I wanted to let you know that I am not giving up the ownership position. I will be more than happy to give you co-owner like we previously discussed and we can go from there. You will be able to freely moderate and develop SERENA like you mentioned and we can start implementing the monetization policy together. You can still take credit for the features you develop like you did in your LinkedIn with SERENA. I know this place was built by you, but I was there since day 1 too and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to go ahead with this, at least not right now. 

We‚Äôll see how things look in a month or two, but I will not consider it until you are in Italy and settled into your uni.


[17.09.2024 17:42] peachyqiss
is this good?


[17.09.2024 17:42] peachyqiss
let me know what i should change üôè


[17.09.2024 17:42] niltheoverkill
Yepp looks good if you're comfortable sending it


[17.09.2024 17:43] peachyqiss
is there anything i should add/take away?


[17.09.2024 17:43] peachyqiss
i feel like i‚Äôm being really harsh


[17.09.2024 17:43] niltheoverkill
no there is a difference between being confident and stern and harsh


[17.09.2024 17:44] peachyqiss
okay, sending it


[17.09.2024 17:44] peachyqiss
thank you for being here for me nil


[17.09.2024 17:44] niltheoverkill
Go for it


[17.09.2024 17:44] niltheoverkill

[17.09.2024 21:30] niltheoverkill
let me try to get in aswell


[17.09.2024 21:30] niltheoverkill
i think we're going to have to resort to manually inviting every member


[17.09.2024 21:30] niltheoverkill
which sucks


[17.09.2024 21:30] niltheoverkill
but if we split lets say 200 per staff


[17.09.2024 21:30] niltheoverkill
we can manage


[17.09.2024 21:31] peachyqiss
yeah i think we can do that

[17.09.2024 21:41] niltheoverkill

[17.09.2024 21:41] peachyqiss

[17.09.2024 21:41] niltheoverkill

[17.09.2024 21:41] peachyqiss

..


[18.09.2024 01:22] peachyqiss

[18.09.2024 01:23] peachyqiss
don‚Äôt worry, we can worry about it tmrw :D


[18.09.2024 01:23] peachyqiss

[18.09.2024 01:23] peachyqiss
is there anything else for us to do?


[18.09.2024 01:23] niltheoverkill
Hey, don‚Äôt change anything in your schedule because of this


[18.09.2024 01:24] niltheoverkill
There is a lot but right now we both get a couple hours off


[18.09.2024 01:24] peachyqiss
i‚Äôm going to

- set up ticket bot
- set up channel perms
- set up intro/verification channel
- set up automod
- check SERENA again
- maybe set up lofi vcs
- try to see how we can do the club thing again

{Reactions}
üëç

[18.09.2024 01:25] peachyqiss
the club thing with SERENA was really great UGH i‚Äôm so mad


[18.09.2024 01:25] niltheoverkill
Also, I think you know I should craft a message to send to reyna
If you want to, of course


[18.09.2024 01:25] peachyqiss
you can, i know many people have reached out


[18.09.2024 01:25] peachyqiss
jazzi did and she sent a long response then deleted it right after


[18.09.2024 01:25] niltheoverkill
Hey, it‚Äôs all right. We‚Äôll get it all going again, baby steps


[18.09.2024 01:26] peachyqiss
pretty sure she blocked me though, not sure


[18.09.2024 01:26] niltheoverkill
Don‚Äôt worry, I have ways of reaching her


[18.09.2024 01:26] niltheoverkill
She still needs me so I‚Äôm assuming she won‚Äôt block me off


[18.09.2024 01:26] peachyqiss
i feel bad but i‚Äôm glad we were right about it being impulse


[18.09.2024 01:26] peachyqiss
because this definitely proves it


[18.09.2024 01:27] niltheoverkill
I‚Äôm just scared of a person that can ruin the lives of a lot of people with a couple clicks of a button


[18.09.2024 01:27] peachyqiss
and i know it was her work and everything, but why would she throw it all away like that because i wanted her to move first? then tell a handful of members lies of what happened?


[18.09.2024 01:27] peachyqiss
yeah


[18.09.2024 01:27] niltheoverkill
Rage is the powerful emotion


[18.09.2024 01:27] niltheoverkill
So is jealousy


[18.09.2024 01:27] peachyqiss
i also hated how everyone said everything was all her, like you didn‚Äôt program so much of SERENA and hold all of the events, and i didn‚Äôt expand the server a ton


[18.09.2024 01:28] peachyqiss
i don‚Äôt know it just rubbed me the wrong way


[18.09.2024 01:28] niltheoverkill
Our job is done the same way even if we don‚Äôt get recognition for it so I don‚Äôt mind honestly


[18.09.2024 01:29] niltheoverkill
Thats fair


[18.09.2024 01:29] niltheoverkill
This is like saying a president saved a country though, one person represents the group of people that worked behind-the-scenes


[18.09.2024 01:29] peachyqiss
yeah that‚Äôs true, i‚Äôm not expecting praise or anything, but giving praise to just one person when it was a team is what is icky


[18.09.2024 01:29] peachyqiss
that‚Äôs true


[18.09.2024 01:30] peachyqiss
nil you‚Äôre so wise when you‚Äôre tired


[18.09.2024 01:30] niltheoverkill
Yeah, not being seen by the people you trust hurts really bad and I get that

[23.09.2024 18:43] niltheoverkill

[23.09.2024 18:50] peachyqiss

[23.09.2024 18:50] niltheoverkill
gosh i keep forgetting that exists


[23.09.2024 18:50] niltheoverkill
let me check ty ty


[23.09.2024 22:14] niltheoverkill
hey i've been thinking about something


[23.09.2024 22:14] niltheoverkill
i love nisan i really do but what the fuck is she doing as co owner


[23.09.2024 22:14] niltheoverkill
same level of activity as harriet


[23.09.2024 22:15] peachyqiss
yeah i don‚Äôt really know


[23.09.2024 22:15] peachyqiss
i‚Äôve been thinking too but she is a day 1 and she does contribute when she‚Äôs here


[23.09.2024 22:16] niltheoverkill
thats true


[23.09.2024 22:16] niltheoverkill
im not bothered to the point where im gonna nuke the server (!)


[23.09.2024 22:16] peachyqiss
LMFAO


[23.09.2024 22:16] niltheoverkill
just food for thought


[23.09.2024 22:16] niltheoverkill
yknow


[23.09.2024 22:16] peachyqiss
i‚Äôm not going to demote her right now but i will talk to her about being active


[23.09.2024 22:16] niltheoverkill
yeah that makes sense


[23.09.2024 22:17] peachyqiss
bc there was a dry spot with you but i wanted to make sure it was just an episodic thing


[23.09.2024 22:17] peachyqiss
i want to give her the same opportunity yk


[23.09.2024 22:17] niltheoverkill
mhm


[23.09.2024 22:18] niltheoverkill
let me chat with her actually we havent had a conversation in a long time


[23.09.2024 22:18] peachyqiss
okok!


[23.09.2024 22:18] peachyqiss
just check up on her tho


[23.09.2024 22:18] niltheoverkill
yep


[23.09.2024 22:22] peachyqiss
also i just wanted to say thank you for everything you‚Äôre doing right now. you‚Äôve been the saving grace with everything right now and the server would not have made the comeback it did without you


[23.09.2024 22:23] peachyqiss
you mean so much to me and having you in my corner really means a lot


[23.09.2024 22:23] niltheoverkill
thanks for saying that ‚ù§Ô∏è im just doing what i can

[23.09.2024 22:23] niltheoverkill
it almost seemed like reyna was the only one on the "tech" side but what we forgot in my absence is that we started everything together


[23.09.2024 22:24] peachyqiss
nahhh you‚Äôre doing way more, i‚Äôm just really glad that i can go to sleep without worrying what will happen when im gone because you‚Äôll be there


[23.09.2024 22:24] niltheoverkill
she told me that she was going to hand the server over to me if i was active so i kinda feel guilty of "making her give it to you" but you've been a great owner so far and probably doing a better job than i could


[23.09.2024 22:24] niltheoverkill
and im glad i can go to sleep knowing you're awake :)


[23.09.2024 22:25] peachyqiss
i was actually really surprised when she did give it to me bc you seemed like such an obvious choice


[23.09.2024 22:25] niltheoverkill
really?


[23.09.2024 22:25] niltheoverkill
damn


[23.09.2024 22:25] peachyqiss
yeah


[23.09.2024 22:25] peachyqiss
i mean don‚Äôt get me wrong i‚Äôm glad she gave it to me


[23.09.2024 22:25] peachyqiss
but it was kind of a shock


[23.09.2024 22:25] niltheoverkill
if my presence is so persistent even when im gone, im shocked at what ppl think of me


[23.09.2024 22:26] niltheoverkill
me too


[23.09.2024 22:26] niltheoverkill
if she wanted it back i wouldve said no immediately by the way, i wouldnt be as nice as you were


[23.09.2024 22:26] peachyqiss
:chilewhat: thank you so much that means everything to me


[23.09.2024 22:26] niltheoverkill
hence: she wouldve probably went ahead and done worse


[23.09.2024 22:26] niltheoverkill

if we could do more like


[26.01.2025 23:17] peachyqiss
12-3pm CST i think that could work for a lot of westerners


[26.01.2025 23:17] peachyqiss
it'll be 10am for the west coast and 1pm for the easat


[26.01.2025 23:17] peachyqiss

[26.01.2025 23:17] peachyqiss

[26.01.2025 23:19] niltheoverkill
4 hours backward?


[26.01.2025 23:59] niltheoverkill
im gonna just

[20.02.2025 19:45] niltheoverkill
OH SHOOT my MINECRAFT WORLDS


[20.02.2025 19:47] peachyqiss
OH NO


[20.02.2025 19:47] peachyqiss
wait why are you doing a reset anyways


[20.02.2025 19:47] niltheoverkill
Im still in the backup phase we‚Äôre goood


[20.02.2025 19:48] niltheoverkill
There is a very specific issue with my WebCam and I have had two phone calls with customer support and I have spent hours on Reddit and different forms but nothing seems to be the solution but we know for a fact that is driver related and I have gotten multiple suggestions about doing the windows reset and I figured since my second semester starts on Wednesday this is the perfect time to do it


[20.02.2025 19:48] niltheoverkill
Bit of a long explanation, but this is the Lore behind it


[20.02.2025 19:48] peachyqiss
damn


[20.02.2025 19:48] peachyqiss
usually to reinstall a driver you don‚Äôt have to do a reset


[20.02.2025 19:48] niltheoverkill
Yeah, we did everything you could imagine probably


[20.02.2025 19:48] niltheoverkill
Did that multiple times


[20.02.2025 19:48] niltheoverkill
Bios resets


[20.02.2025 19:49] niltheoverkill
Something called a static discharge that I didn‚Äôt even know existed


[20.02.2025 19:49] peachyqiss
jeez


[20.02.2025 19:49] peachyqiss
good luck queen üòî


[20.02.2025 19:49] niltheoverkill
I have so many video call meetings that I just cannot live like this so I‚Äôm done


[20.02.2025 19:49] niltheoverkill
Thanks babes


[20.02.2025 19:49] peachyqiss
right no i get it


[20.02.2025 19:49] niltheoverkill
Also for your information, I have officially started the process to apply for a masters in the US


[20.02.2025 19:49] niltheoverkill
I have a professional coach that is going to help me through it and if I get in, I‚Äôm starting in the 2026 2027 academic year


[20.02.2025 19:50] peachyqiss
YAYYYYY


[20.02.2025 19:50] peachyqiss
what uni?


[20.02.2025 19:50] niltheoverkill
Super excited honestly


[20.02.2025 19:50] niltheoverkill
Thats the thing idk yet


[20.02.2025 19:50] niltheoverkill
The usual probably I‚Äôm going to apply to about 20 places maybe a little less maybe a little more


[20.02.2025 19:51] niltheoverkill
As one does


[20.02.2025 19:51] peachyqiss
oh damn that‚Äôs gonna be expensive


[20.02.2025 19:51] niltheoverkill
I am very aware yes


[20.02.2025 19:51] niltheoverkill
And the coaching wasn‚Äôt cheap either


[20.02.2025 19:51] niltheoverkill
But if I can secure a scholarship, which is much easier to get in the masters degree, I will be more than happy to spend all of this money in this process applying and getting coaching


[20.02.2025 19:51] niltheoverkill
Also, this is basically me putting my foot into the US and if I get a job offer, I‚Äôm staying there you know?


[20.02.2025 19:52] peachyqiss
yeah i get you


[20.02.2025 19:52] niltheoverkill

[20.02.2025 19:55] peachyqiss
LMFAO


[20.02.2025 19:55] peachyqiss
i haven‚Äôt committed yet


[20.02.2025 19:55] peachyqiss
but it‚Äôs getting more and more appealing idk


[20.02.2025 19:56] niltheoverkill
I‚Äôm sure you will rely on your sixth sense to make a good decision


[20.02.2025 19:56] niltheoverkill
Once you think about it, it can virtually never leave your mind so you‚Äôre gonna be constantly thinking about it even if you don‚Äôt commit in the end


[20.02.2025 19:56] peachyqiss
true


[20.02.2025 19:56] peachyqiss
i think i‚Äôm going to do it, i just have to commit by april


[20.02.2025 19:56] niltheoverkill
Oh, you have tons of time


[20.02.2025 19:57] niltheoverkill
I think you will have made your mind like 100% by then definitely


[20.02.2025 19:57] peachyqiss
yeah for sure


[20.02.2025 19:57] peachyqiss
especially if i get more advising on it


[20.02.2025 19:58] niltheoverkill
You guys have people that you can talk to about this at your university right?


[20.02.2025 19:58] niltheoverkill
I don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre called that shows how they dont exist here LOL


[20.02.2025 20:01] peachyqiss
LOL yes we do


[20.02.2025 20:01] peachyqiss
we have a career center which is the unbiased place to go, and then there are advisors for each major


[20.02.2025 20:02] niltheoverkill
Oh that sounds lovely


[20.02.2025 20:02] peachyqiss
it really is


[20.02.2025 20:02] peachyqiss
i‚Äôm surprised yall don‚Äôt have that


[20.02.2025 20:03] niltheoverkill
Think of Europe as like a place with human rights, but like 50% of the time


[20.02.2025 20:03] niltheoverkill
And Italy make that 25%


[20.02.2025 20:03] niltheoverkill
I had an issue with a professor and I tried to email like an ethics committee or something and it‚Äôs been a week and I still haven‚Äôt gotten a response


[20.02.2025 20:04] peachyqiss
oh shit


[20.02.2025 20:05] niltheoverkill
Yeah anyways SUPER STOKED FOR YOU TO COME


[20.02.2025 20:05] niltheoverkill
HAHAAHHAHAHAH


[20.02.2025 20:06] niltheoverkill
Food is good and the history is good Those two are the only things about this place that I like honestly


[20.02.2025 20:07] peachyqiss
LMFAOO sounds about right


[20.02.2025 20:08] niltheoverkill
By the way when you come, it‚Äôs gonna be extremely hot so come prepared


[20.02.2025 20:08] peachyqiss
like how hot


[20.02.2025 20:08] niltheoverkill
I don‚Äôt know how hot it is where you live, but I‚Äôm assuming not this much


[20.02.2025 20:08] peachyqiss
a typical summer for me is 95-100 degrees


[20.02.2025 20:08] peachyqiss
F


[20.02.2025 20:08] niltheoverkill
I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to describe it other than saying that I almost passed out once


[20.02.2025 20:08] peachyqiss
let me make that into celsius hold on


[20.02.2025 20:08] niltheoverkill
It‚Äôs not too hot in general, but like the humidity is super high


[20.02.2025 20:08] niltheoverkill
And the fact that there is no AC in most places makes it worse


[20.02.2025 20:09] peachyqiss
35-38 degrees C


[20.02.2025 20:09] niltheoverkill
Yeah, a bit more


[20.02.2025 20:09] peachyqiss
yeah that‚Äôs probably gonna be the worst part


[20.02.2025 20:09] niltheoverkill
Even if it‚Äôs like 30¬∞ out the fact that there‚Äôs no air conditioning and the fact that the humidity is high I think it makes it unbearable


[20.02.2025 20:09] peachyqiss
yeah


[20.02.2025 20:09] niltheoverkill
If you said 40¬∞C with air-conditioning or 30¬∞C with no air conditioning, you know which one I‚Äôm gonna pick


[20.02.2025 20:09] peachyqiss
i can handle humidity (i live by an ocean) it just sucks a ton üò≠


[20.02.2025 20:10] peachyqiss
damn right


[20.02.2025 20:10] niltheoverkill
That‚Äôs good then you probably have appropriate clothing for the weather as well


[20.02.2025 20:10] niltheoverkill
When I first came here, I didn‚Äôt


[20.02.2025 20:10] peachyqiss
yeah lots of tanks and shorts


[20.02.2025 20:10] peachyqiss
