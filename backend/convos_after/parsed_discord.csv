niltheoverkill,Hey
niltheoverkill,Ruthie
niltheoverkill,Is there any chance you have proof
niltheoverkill,Of that guy's messages
niltheoverkill,We just got in contact with another admin in that server and we've been telling them about this
niltheoverkill,She's a girl so we're hoping she gets it
peachyqiss,hey i can look! sorry i was in class
niltheoverkill,yeah no worries
niltheoverkill,take your time
niltheoverkill,but dont take too long-
niltheoverkill,hey
niltheoverkill,are you here
peachyqiss,IM SORRY IWAS IN CALCULUS
peachyqiss,getting the screenshots now
peachyqiss,"we only had one convo prior and it was meeting each other, and i had only been to two study sessions at that point"
peachyqiss,this was my bio in the server he found me in
niltheoverkill,"OK, first of all, I just wanna say"
niltheoverkill,Do not send your pictures to strange men on the Internet
niltheoverkill,Do not even text them
niltheoverkill,Do not even breathe the same air as them
niltheoverkill,"But as the adult in the room, it is more his fault than yours"
niltheoverkill,Please be more cautious next time
peachyqiss,"yeah :( i figured that since we already had a cam-on study session it wouldn’t be that bad bc he already saw who i was. it was after that that i realized “damn, he’s a creep” and wanted to take it all back"
peachyqiss,defo won’t happen again.
peachyqiss,"hey nil, reyna passed over ownership to me and i was just wondering if you could gauge how active you'll be on the server. if you can't mod that's fine, but i would love if you could be more active in case we need to update SERENA. i'm intermediate with python but i've never taken on a project like this, so having you around would be really really helpful!"
peachyqiss,"not trying to rush of pressure you or anything, but if you don't get back to me soon, i'm going to have to start looking for other programmers to help with development if you can't"
niltheoverkill,"hey, i just saw everything today firstly - CONGRATS 🎊 uni for me starts in a couple days (unfortunately) so i most certainly will be 10x more active than i am right now, i know almost everything regarding the bot so ofc i'll help to the best of my abilities"
niltheoverkill,i think most of the development part has been completed so from now on it will be minor fixes
peachyqiss,"THANK YOU! yeah, we just need to have a few fixes and the ability to add things when needed. i know python to an extent but it’s nice to have someone who’s well versed with the bot and more fluent/can get projects done more efficiently than me i’m glad you’ll be more active!! hopefully we can start up another back to school event or a movie night soon!"
niltheoverkill,oh i'd love to get back into hosting events for the server i kinda miss it too
niltheoverkill,a back to school event for SURE
peachyqiss,yeah! we’ve tried hosting events over the summer but you were amazing at them
niltheoverkill,:catsobbing:
niltheoverkill,i kinda had a shit summer but thats not an excuse to bail im sorry about that :(
peachyqiss,"it’s okay! we all have our struggles and i totally get that! just let me know when something is going on so i can plan ahead okay? no details or anything, a simple “hey ruthie something came up and im not going to be online for x amount of time” works!"
peachyqiss,"the server isn’t the only thing in our lives and i totally get that, i just want to stay in the loop so everything is accounted for :)"
niltheoverkill,yeah thats only fair
niltheoverkill,hey how are you by the way
niltheoverkill,college n shit 🤪
peachyqiss,"i’m good, uni started about a week or two ago and i’ve been RUNNING"
niltheoverkill,that first week is a hustle as per usual
peachyqiss,learning two new programming languages while doing other stuff is hard 😭
peachyqiss,yeah it’s not been the best
niltheoverkill,ouuu what are you learning?
peachyqiss,C and MATLab
peachyqiss,it’s horrible 😭
niltheoverkill,oh gosh
niltheoverkill,best of luck
niltheoverkill,NOT LIKE THATS ROCKET SCIENCE PUHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
niltheoverkill,...
peachyqiss,HAHAHAHA
niltheoverkill,i'll um shut up now
peachyqiss,we got an assignment on wednesday from our intro to aerospace professor that was due last night. he said his class wouldn’t be a culling class but tell me why he demanded we have 10 projects in MATLab
peachyqiss,all due within 4 days
peachyqiss,and saturday we had a football game so none of us could do it that day
peachyqiss,my final work was 21 pages 😭
niltheoverkill,crazy
niltheoverkill,insanity
peachyqiss,yeah i hate to say that i did in fact use chat gpt
peachyqiss,for a few of the questions 😭
niltheoverkill,i would be surprised if someone didnt use chatgpt
peachyqiss,REAL
niltheoverkill,it's a personal tutor at this point
niltheoverkill,like
niltheoverkill,free and educational?
peachyqiss,one of the questions actually involved linear algebra (a course we don’t learn until our 3rd year)
niltheoverkill,wait WHAT
peachyqiss,YEAH
niltheoverkill,we have linear algebra on our 1st year 1st semester
niltheoverkill,💀
peachyqiss,wait yall go to college then uni right?
peachyqiss,i can’t remember how europe does school
niltheoverkill,this happens all the time thoughhh professors dont know what the other courses and there are constant mixups
niltheoverkill,thats only in the uk afaik
niltheoverkill,im going into my last (3rd) year of uni
peachyqiss,yeah and he’s from canada and it’s his first year here 😭 which makes it worse
peachyqiss,ohhhh okok
niltheoverkill,he'll apologize and fix it immediately then lmfao
peachyqiss,we went to his office hours and he didn’t say anything :chilewhat:
peachyqiss,his two assistants didn’t help at all either
peachyqiss,they said if they helped us then they would be “spoon feeding” and we’re just “not in the right mindset”
niltheoverkill,we just assume they know what they're doing but if i learned ONE THING in higher education it's that nobody and i mean NOBODY knows what they are doing
peachyqiss,REAL
peachyqiss,that’s so real
niltheoverkill,well feed me like a mama bird so i can fly out of the nest
peachyqiss,this is our curriculum sheet
niltheoverkill,hopefully your other classes' staff are more help
niltheoverkill,hey this is actually kinda pleasant
peachyqiss,you can arrange it differently depending on how many classes you passed in high school though
peachyqiss,i know it’s so nice
peachyqiss,the computer engineering program’s sheet is a flow chart
niltheoverkill,omfg i love american colleges for this shit
peachyqiss,it’s so hard to read
peachyqiss,YES ITS SO PEAK
niltheoverkill,in a language they can understand 💀
peachyqiss,💀
niltheoverkill,MOM I AM A RICH MAN
peachyqiss,💍🧎‍♀️
niltheoverkill,Hey Ruthie
niltheoverkill,How are you doing
peachyqiss,"hey, i’m okay"
peachyqiss,a little stressed
niltheoverkill,What’s wrong?
peachyqiss,reyna is asking for owner back and it’s really out of left field
niltheoverkill,"Yeah, actually I came here to talk to you about that"
peachyqiss,oh man
peachyqiss,okay
niltheoverkill,I think it’s very disrespectful that she did that
niltheoverkill,I am aware that she’s confused and a bit lost so she doesn’t know what to do
niltheoverkill,But you have every right to say no
niltheoverkill,"In fact, I think I would’ve said no myself"
niltheoverkill,"Whatever you say, I’m with you on this one"
niltheoverkill,You want me to say something to her i will
peachyqiss,nono it’s okay
peachyqiss,can you just make sure i’m not being crazy?
niltheoverkill,Yeah
niltheoverkill,Ur not
niltheoverkill,🫵
niltheoverkill,"She’s been thinking of texting you for a long time and she has brought up the idea of asking the ownership back to me in dms like 1-2 weeks ago - I told her that it was a bad idea, but if she really really wanted to, she should just talk to you (i said “whats the harm, just ask”)"
niltheoverkill,"And I told her “Ruthie has every right to say no, you know that right?”"
niltheoverkill,I’m translating because the conversation is in Turkish obviously
niltheoverkill,Reading now give me a min
peachyqiss,"this is all that i said after, but yeah"
niltheoverkill,"Sorry to break it to you but some things she said here seem like lies to me - they’re small lies, but still lies"
niltheoverkill,Yeah no
niltheoverkill,"That’s not the part I should be focused on though, her personal life as long as it doesn’t affect the server shouldn’t bother me"
niltheoverkill,I think you put it in quite a delicate way
peachyqiss,i just feel bad because I want her to have the opportunity to adjust to her new life without having to worry. she’s literally moving to a new country and i don’t want the server to be affected again
niltheoverkill,No takebacksies :fingerWave:
peachyqiss,but she said i was back stabbing her
peachyqiss,and like that really hurts because she knows how loyal i am to her and her ideas?
niltheoverkill,"Yeah, I think she knows and she’s just a bit angry right now"
peachyqiss,"if i backstabbed her she wouldn’t be in the staff server, she wouldn’t have the founder role, etc etc"
niltheoverkill,You still gave her the courtesy of staying in the inner circle
niltheoverkill,I think that in itself is really big
peachyqiss,but i did all of that because i do care about her and i want her to see what we’re doing
peachyqiss,yeah
peachyqiss,i don’t know
peachyqiss,i feel like she’s making it really personal
niltheoverkill,She also texted me rn saying Ruthie didn’t give it back and I said why should she?
niltheoverkill,Yes
peachyqiss,i think she forgot i was a day 1 too. sure not mod but i saw everything since before it was girls only
peachyqiss,and i was made a mod on like
peachyqiss,day 3
peachyqiss,😭
peachyqiss,"but you were also day 1, and nisan and jazzi"
peachyqiss,"i know it’s a big thing for her and i did say i would give it back, i just want her to be sure"
peachyqiss,"because she can say she’s ready, then she’ll actually get to italy and get super stressed again"
niltheoverkill,That’s right and that’s what I’m thinking is going to happen as well
peachyqiss,same
niltheoverkill,She thinks she’s ready she is NOT i can tell you that
niltheoverkill,Even if she is - it’s going to take a lot of mental effort to adjust and also the time
peachyqiss,i can literally pull up the messages where she agreed to the co thing though. it’s kind of frustrating she’s going back on that
peachyqiss,like
niltheoverkill,I think you should just hit her with a hard no right now
niltheoverkill,That’s probably the only thing that’s going to stop this conversation on and on
peachyqiss,yeah
niltheoverkill,Full 180
peachyqiss,"i might just say “i can give you co. you can tell me about your ideas for the server and i would love to implement them with you. you will still take responsibility for every facet you develop, like before. but i am not comfortable giving up everything before you adjust to uni in italy for at least a month”"
peachyqiss,actually i might omit the last part
peachyqiss,idk
peachyqiss,she was a good owner but i’m so nervous
niltheoverkill,Don’t be
niltheoverkill,You call the shots now
peachyqiss,i know but this was all hers
niltheoverkill,And she made the executive decision to gift it all to you
niltheoverkill,"This sounds good, I would keep the last* part, but I don’t know what your personal relationship with her is"
peachyqiss,we’re close i think
niltheoverkill,"If you feel comfortable enough to keep it in, I would say keep it in"
peachyqiss,"okay, i just don’t want to go back on it if the month goes by and she’s still not ready"
peachyqiss,i hate going back on my word like that idk
niltheoverkill,I think you should just say we’ll see what happens in a month
niltheoverkill,And I’ll bet you that she’ll be glad she didn’t take the ownership back in a month
peachyqiss,thank you bio
peachyqiss,nil*
niltheoverkill,no problem chem
niltheoverkill,ruthie*
peachyqiss,HAHAHA
peachyqiss,i was really stressing about this but you made it so much better
peachyqiss,seriously thank you so much
niltheoverkill,"Don’t worry, I got your back"
peachyqiss,if you need anything let me know
niltheoverkill,Likewise
niltheoverkill,"Let me know how it goes, but I assume I’ll be getting information from both sides 🤭"
peachyqiss,"i’ll let you know how the thing with reyna goes, i’ll probably text her in like 3/4 hours because that’s when i get out of class"
peachyqiss,yeah ofc ofc
niltheoverkill,yeaah ofc fcus on your class right now this is secondary
niltheoverkill,I texted her no takebacksies :fingerWave: 15 mins ago and she hasnt responded HAHAHAHAZHHS
peachyqiss,NO WAY
niltheoverkill,make that 1.5 hrs rn
peachyqiss,i’m in between classes right now but i think i’ll just text her the main thing and stop responding when i go to class bc i don’t want her to think im avoiding her bc im texting in the servers
niltheoverkill,good call
peachyqiss,"Hey, I’m in between classes right now but I have been thinking and I wanted to let you know that I am not giving up the ownership position. I will be more than happy to give you co-owner like we previously discussed and we can go from there. You will be able to freely moderate and develop SERENA like you mentioned and we can start implementing the monetization policy together. You can still take credit for the features you develop like you did in your LinkedIn with SERENA. I know this place was built by you, but I was there since day 1 too and I don’t think it’s a good idea to go ahead with this, at least not right now. We’ll see how things look in a month or two, but I will not consider it until you are in Italy and settled into your uni."
peachyqiss,is this good?
peachyqiss,let me know what i should change 🙏
niltheoverkill,Yepp looks good if you're comfortable sending it
peachyqiss,is there anything i should add/take away?
peachyqiss,i feel like i’m being really harsh
niltheoverkill,no there is a difference between being confident and stern and harsh
peachyqiss,"okay, sending it"
peachyqiss,thank you for being here for me nil
niltheoverkill,Go for it
niltheoverkill,Of course
niltheoverkill,Anytime
peachyqiss,okay she’s fine
niltheoverkill,i gotchu
niltheoverkill,hold on
peachyqiss,tyty
peachyqiss,"thank you sm, she sent me the instructions but not the ip bc i had access to it"
niltheoverkill,let me try to get in aswell
niltheoverkill,i think we're going to have to resort to manually inviting every member
niltheoverkill,which sucks
niltheoverkill,but if we split lets say 200 per staff
niltheoverkill,we can manage
peachyqiss,yeah i think we can do that
niltheoverkill,this is good
niltheoverkill,"it says ""failed to kick"""
niltheoverkill,does it say that for everyone
niltheoverkill,thats a list of usernames i can extract
peachyqiss,"not everyone, but i know not everyone is banned. i checked the discord ban logs"
niltheoverkill,it's formatted yknow
peachyqiss,but in the audit logs of discord we can see everyone that was kicked
peachyqiss,here i'll share my screen
niltheoverkill,hey ruthie
niltheoverkill,i couldnt access from putty
niltheoverkill,any chance you still have yours on or something?
niltheoverkill,i dont know what might be causing it
niltheoverkill,i cant run source venv/bin/activate
peachyqiss,yeah i have mine
peachyqiss,i’m at practice rn but i’ll get home asap
niltheoverkill,Have a great practice!
peachyqiss,I just got out! :D
peachyqiss,okay tell me what commands i should run in puTTY to get what we need
niltheoverkill,Me asf in bed rn
peachyqiss,HAHAHAHA
peachyqiss,i’m so sorry i know it’s so late for you
niltheoverkill,No no its ok
niltheoverkill,Actually
niltheoverkill,I dont know yet
niltheoverkill,I think I need to research
niltheoverkill,..
peachyqiss,"yeah same, i can’t think of anything off of the top of my head"
peachyqiss,"don’t worry, we can worry about it tmrw :D"
peachyqiss,when i wake up you’re awake so we can do it then
niltheoverkill,What the hell was I thinking broo im sorry I’ll let you know when I have a clear answer
peachyqiss,i’ll wake up early so i’ll have time before class
niltheoverkill,Perfect
peachyqiss,nooooo dwdwdw
peachyqiss,is there anything else for us to do?
niltheoverkill,"Hey, don’t change anything in your schedule because of this"
niltheoverkill,There is a lot but right now we both get a couple hours off
peachyqiss,i’m going to - set up ticket bot - set up channel perms - set up intro/verification channel - set up automod - check SERENA again - maybe set up lofi vcs - try to see how we can do the club thing again
peachyqiss,the club thing with SERENA was really great UGH i’m so mad
niltheoverkill,"Also, I think you know I should craft a message to send to reyna If you want to, of course"
peachyqiss,"you can, i know many people have reached out"
peachyqiss,jazzi did and she sent a long response then deleted it right after
niltheoverkill,"Hey, it’s all right. We’ll get it all going again, baby steps"
peachyqiss,"pretty sure she blocked me though, not sure"
niltheoverkill,"Don’t worry, I have ways of reaching her"
niltheoverkill,She still needs me so I’m assuming she won’t block me off
peachyqiss,i feel bad but i’m glad we were right about it being impulse
peachyqiss,because this definitely proves it
niltheoverkill,I’m just scared of a person that can ruin the lives of a lot of people with a couple clicks of a button
peachyqiss,"and i know it was her work and everything, but why would she throw it all away like that because i wanted her to move first? then tell a handful of members lies of what happened?"
peachyqiss,yeah
niltheoverkill,Rage is the powerful emotion
niltheoverkill,So is jealousy
peachyqiss,"i also hated how everyone said everything was all her, like you didn’t program so much of SERENA and hold all of the events, and i didn’t expand the server a ton"
peachyqiss,i don’t know it just rubbed me the wrong way
niltheoverkill,Our job is done the same way even if we don’t get recognition for it so I don’t mind honestly
niltheoverkill,Thats fair
niltheoverkill,"This is like saying a president saved a country though, one person represents the group of people that worked behind-the-scenes"
peachyqiss,"yeah that’s true, i’m not expecting praise or anything, but giving praise to just one person when it was a team is what is icky"
peachyqiss,that’s true
peachyqiss,nil you’re so wise when you’re tired
niltheoverkill,"Yeah, not being seen by the people you trust hurts really bad and I get that"
niltheoverkill,DUDEE AHAHHSGSHSSHH
peachyqiss,HAHAHAHAHAHA
niltheoverkill,I’m just depressed these days homie
niltheoverkill,😭
niltheoverkill,Just kidding it’s obviously loss of a lot of blood today that got to my brain
niltheoverkill,website's down
niltheoverkill,did you know?
niltheoverkill,she deleted the entire git repo of the website i think
niltheoverkill,i still have all the code to the website
peachyqiss,you’re kidding
niltheoverkill,Im afraid not
niltheoverkill,i know ur sleeping rn but im so excited
niltheoverkill,because i got the entirety of the website back
niltheoverkill,"and published it, removing reyna of course"
niltheoverkill,Girls Only - A Girls Only Student Community Join our 24/7 online girls only study space and chat with other students.
niltheoverkill,we could even get the same domain again because some of the payments are made
peachyqiss,YAY IM SO EXCITED!!! THANK YOU!!!
niltheoverkill,i got our gmail its own discord account
niltheoverkill,do we have the server logo
niltheoverkill,i want to set it as a pfp
peachyqiss,"i don’t rn but i can get it, maybe check the drive to see if it’s in there already"
niltheoverkill,gosh i keep forgetting that exists
niltheoverkill,let me check ty ty
niltheoverkill,hey i've been thinking about something
niltheoverkill,i love nisan i really do but what the fuck is she doing as co owner
niltheoverkill,same level of activity as harriet
peachyqiss,yeah i don’t really know
peachyqiss,i’ve been thinking too but she is a day 1 and she does contribute when she’s here
niltheoverkill,thats true
niltheoverkill,im not bothered to the point where im gonna nuke the server (!)
peachyqiss,LMFAO
niltheoverkill,just food for thought
niltheoverkill,yknow
peachyqiss,i’m not going to demote her right now but i will talk to her about being active
niltheoverkill,yeah that makes sense
peachyqiss,bc there was a dry spot with you but i wanted to make sure it was just an episodic thing
peachyqiss,i want to give her the same opportunity yk
niltheoverkill,mhm
niltheoverkill,let me chat with her actually we havent had a conversation in a long time
peachyqiss,okok!
peachyqiss,just check up on her tho
niltheoverkill,yep
peachyqiss,also i just wanted to say thank you for everything you’re doing right now. you’ve been the saving grace with everything right now and the server would not have made the comeback it did without you
peachyqiss,you mean so much to me and having you in my corner really means a lot
niltheoverkill,thanks for saying that ❤️ im just doing what i can
niltheoverkill,"it almost seemed like reyna was the only one on the ""tech"" side but what we forgot in my absence is that we started everything together"
peachyqiss,"nahhh you’re doing way more, i’m just really glad that i can go to sleep without worrying what will happen when im gone because you’ll be there"
niltheoverkill,"she told me that she was going to hand the server over to me if i was active so i kinda feel guilty of ""making her give it to you"" but you've been a great owner so far and probably doing a better job than i could"
niltheoverkill,and im glad i can go to sleep knowing you're awake :)
peachyqiss,i was actually really surprised when she did give it to me bc you seemed like such an obvious choice
niltheoverkill,really?
niltheoverkill,damn
peachyqiss,yeah
peachyqiss,i mean don’t get me wrong i’m glad she gave it to me
peachyqiss,but it was kind of a shock
niltheoverkill,"if my presence is so persistent even when im gone, im shocked at what ppl think of me"
niltheoverkill,me too
niltheoverkill,"if she wanted it back i wouldve said no immediately by the way, i wouldnt be as nice as you were"
peachyqiss,:chilewhat: thank you so much that means everything to me
niltheoverkill,hence: she wouldve probably went ahead and done worse
niltheoverkill,past tense + past tense MY ENGLISH IS CRUMBLING
peachyqiss,HAHAHAHA
niltheoverkill,"im more of a straightforward person, i say things mostly as they come to my mind so..."
peachyqiss,you’re doing better than me 😭
niltheoverkill,apart
niltheoverkill,a part
peachyqiss,NOOOO
peachyqiss,that will forever haunt me
niltheoverkill,the letters of apart are written apart if a part is seperate than another
peachyqiss,okay now you’re just showing off
peachyqiss,HAHAHAHAHA
niltheoverkill,:megathink:

peachyqiss,i doubt if we brought it up anyone would respond 😭
peachyqiss,jokes
peachyqiss,i think everyone is getting back into their schedule
niltheoverkill,i've been trying to ask everyones opinions before doing things but i just started doing tbh bc noone is responding
niltheoverkill,but i understand everyones busy
peachyqiss,"yeah i’m totally fine w that, i noticed we missed deadlines for opinions on things and ended up not doing an event bc people wouldn’t respond"
niltheoverkill,"including me, im just busy with the server and active bc i have exams"
niltheoverkill,yeah fair
niltheoverkill,show your face around sometime cutie pie
peachyqiss,"lolol don’t worry i’m going to be active in the next few days, i have some homework finally"

peachyqiss,oh shit
peachyqiss,you can show it to me i'll try to figure it out
niltheoverkill,how good are you with poission distribution
niltheoverkill,im already confused i wouldnt wanna get even more confused
peachyqiss,im not gonna lie what the fuck is poission
peachyqiss,LMFAO
peachyqiss,i know very basic probability
niltheoverkill,alr it's been real we are so failing
niltheoverkill,alr then
peachyqiss,we dont have a specific class for it in engineering
niltheoverkill,yeaaah fair
niltheoverkill,we have this small probability course
niltheoverkill,so detailed for no fucking reason
niltheoverkill,thanks anyway btw
niltheoverkill,should we cancel the western reset and just combine the two in one singular event
niltheoverkill,it's been dead for like 2 months
niltheoverkill,for eternity actually but we dont talk about that
peachyqiss,REAL i wasnt gonna bring it up buttt.....
peachyqiss,the only issue is the time i think
peachyqiss,if we could do more like
peachyqiss,12-3pm CST i think that could work for a lot of westerners
peachyqiss,it'll be 10am for the west coast and 1pm for the easat
peachyqiss,east*
peachyqiss,i just dont want to make it too late for the east
niltheoverkill,would that be moving it forward or backward
niltheoverkill,4 hours backward?
niltheoverkill,im gonna just
niltheoverkill,end the event and move to cam2
niltheoverkill,theres like 2 people online total lol
peachyqiss,LMFAO okay
peachyqiss,</3
peachyqiss,yeah thats what i had to do with the last few and then i gradually started forgetting to even start it
niltheoverkill,honestly fair
niltheoverkill,i know that it has been always the lesser of the two events
niltheoverkill,?
niltheoverkill,i just realized you shared the link for the eastern one HAHAHADHASD
niltheoverkill,IF we were to merge the two events
peachyqiss,FUCK
peachyqiss,backward yeah
peachyqiss,sorry i took a shower
niltheoverkill,without me 🥺  👉 👈 ??
niltheoverkill,disgusting im actually gonna kms
peachyqiss,HAHAHAHAHA
niltheoverkill,we could try it out but i dont think the timing is the issue
peachyqiss,next time wife
peachyqiss,nono like i mean the only issue would be timing IF we changed it
peachyqiss,right now i just think the server isn’t very active in the west
niltheoverkill,yeah
peachyqiss,i’m definitely in favor of changing
niltheoverkill,yeah thats what i was trying to say
niltheoverkill,im sorry its like 1 am and im gonna pull an all nighter

peachyqiss,WHY
niltheoverkill,ITS THE SMACK DAB MIDDLE OF ITALY HAHAJDSHAD
niltheoverkill,YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE
peachyqiss,OHHHH
niltheoverkill,but in terms of academics ofc i hope the best uni
peachyqiss,"the program location thing says florence but its called ""engineering mechanics in rome"""
niltheoverkill,daFuq
peachyqiss,its actually gonna be taught by my university staff
peachyqiss,so its not likea  foreign exchange thing
niltheoverkill,solid so location doesnt matter
peachyqiss,right
niltheoverkill,in terms of uni
niltheoverkill,gotcha
peachyqiss,so we get to travel all across italy while we learn
niltheoverkill,fantastic
niltheoverkill,when do you move and how is accomodation done

niltheoverkill,omg amazing im here in july even though im gonna be sweating my ass off to graduate LOL
niltheoverkill,we'll defo see eachother
niltheoverkill,when everything is like
niltheoverkill,determined determined
niltheoverkill,lmk
peachyqiss,i definitely will
niltheoverkill,im so excited bro
niltheoverkill,you got me giggling n shit
niltheoverkill,Im doing a windows reset
niltheoverkill,And im so scared
niltheoverkill,For WHAT? I backed up the important shit idek what im scared about
niltheoverkill,I will be losing all my discord settings though 😬
peachyqiss,like keybinds and stuff?
niltheoverkill,Yeah i dont really care about those ig
niltheoverkill,OH SHOOT my MINECRAFT WORLDS
peachyqiss,OH NO
peachyqiss,wait why are you doing a reset anyways
niltheoverkill,Im still in the backup phase we’re goood
niltheoverkill,There is a very specific issue with my WebCam and I have had two phone calls with customer support and I have spent hours on Reddit and different forms but nothing seems to be the solution but we know for a fact that is driver related and I have gotten multiple suggestions about doing the windows reset and I figured since my second semester starts on Wednesday this is the perfect time to do it
niltheoverkill,"Bit of a long explanation, but this is the Lore behind it"
peachyqiss,damn
peachyqiss,usually to reinstall a driver you don’t have to do a reset
niltheoverkill,"Yeah, we did everything you could imagine probably"
niltheoverkill,Did that multiple times
niltheoverkill,Bios resets
niltheoverkill,Something called a static discharge that I didn’t even know existed
peachyqiss,jeez
peachyqiss,good luck queen 😔
niltheoverkill,I have so many video call meetings that I just cannot live like this so I’m done
niltheoverkill,Thanks babes
peachyqiss,right no i get it
niltheoverkill,"Also for your information, I have officially started the process to apply for a masters in the US"
niltheoverkill,"I have a professional coach that is going to help me through it and if I get in, I’m starting in the 2026 2027 academic year"
peachyqiss,YAYYYYY
peachyqiss,what uni?
niltheoverkill,Super excited honestly
niltheoverkill,Thats the thing idk yet
niltheoverkill,The usual probably I’m going to apply to about 20 places maybe a little less maybe a little more
niltheoverkill,As one does
peachyqiss,oh damn that’s gonna be expensive
niltheoverkill,I am very aware yes
niltheoverkill,And the coaching wasn’t cheap either
niltheoverkill,"But if I can secure a scholarship, which is much easier to get in the masters degree, I will be more than happy to spend all of this money in this process applying and getting coaching"
niltheoverkill,"Also, this is basically me putting my foot into the US and if I get a job offer, I’m staying there you know?"
peachyqiss,yeah i get you
niltheoverkill,Idc bout no trumppp immigration babyyyyyy
niltheoverkill,No this is more ✨brain drain✨
peachyqiss,trump can’t stop a turk on a grind
niltheoverkill,😎
niltheoverkill,Hows the major change treating you
niltheoverkill,It’s not a MAJOR change i hope
peachyqiss,LMFAO
peachyqiss,i haven’t committed yet
peachyqiss,but it’s getting more and more appealing idk
niltheoverkill,I’m sure you will rely on your sixth sense to make a good decision
niltheoverkill,"Once you think about it, it can virtually never leave your mind so you’re gonna be constantly thinking about it even if you don’t commit in the end"
peachyqiss,true
peachyqiss,"i think i’m going to do it, i just have to commit by april"
niltheoverkill,"Oh, you have tons of time"
niltheoverkill,I think you will have made your mind like 100% by then definitely
peachyqiss,yeah for sure
peachyqiss,especially if i get more advising on it
niltheoverkill,You guys have people that you can talk to about this at your university right?
niltheoverkill,I don’t even know what they’re called that shows how they dont exist here LOL
peachyqiss,LOL yes we do
peachyqiss,"we have a career center which is the unbiased place to go, and then there are advisors for each major"
niltheoverkill,Oh that sounds lovely
peachyqiss,it really is
peachyqiss,i’m surprised yall don’t have that
niltheoverkill,"Think of Europe as like a place with human rights, but like 50% of the time"
niltheoverkill,And Italy make that 25%
niltheoverkill,I had an issue with a professor and I tried to email like an ethics committee or something and it’s been a week and I still haven’t gotten a response
peachyqiss,oh shit
niltheoverkill,Yeah anyways SUPER STOKED FOR YOU TO COME
niltheoverkill,HAHAAHHAHAHAH
niltheoverkill,Food is good and the history is good Those two are the only things about this place that I like honestly
peachyqiss,LMFAOO sounds about right
niltheoverkill,"By the way when you come, it’s gonna be extremely hot so come prepared"
peachyqiss,like how hot
niltheoverkill,"I don’t know how hot it is where you live, but I’m assuming not this much"
peachyqiss,a typical summer for me is 95-100 degrees
peachyqiss,F
niltheoverkill,I genuinely don’t know how to describe it other than saying that I almost passed out once
peachyqiss,let me make that into celsius hold on
niltheoverkill,"It’s not too hot in general, but like the humidity is super high"
niltheoverkill,And the fact that there is no AC in most places makes it worse
peachyqiss,35-38 degrees C
niltheoverkill,"Yeah, a bit more"
peachyqiss,yeah that’s probably gonna be the worst part
niltheoverkill,Even if it’s like 30° out the fact that there’s no air conditioning and the fact that the humidity is high I think it makes it unbearable
peachyqiss,yeah
niltheoverkill,"If you said 40°C with air-conditioning or 30°C with no air conditioning, you know which one I’m gonna pick"
peachyqiss,i can handle humidity (i live by an ocean) it just sucks a ton 😭
peachyqiss,damn right
niltheoverkill,That’s good then you probably have appropriate clothing for the weather as well
niltheoverkill,"When I first came here, I didn’t"
peachyqiss,yeah lots of tanks and shorts
peachyqiss,basically bathing suits for clothes lol
niltheoverkill,HAHAHA real
niltheoverkill,Hope you have a strong raincoat though
peachyqiss,LOL i do
niltheoverkill,Last thing you want is rain water getting down between your ass cheeks
niltheoverkill,Definitely never happened to me. I would never let that happen.
